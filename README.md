# Absorb

“Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft.”

This repository will contain all of the programming problems that I work on to
ensure I'm always sharp on my programming skills. I hope to use this repository
as a sort of progress tracker to look back on after I've been working on problems
for a long while.

The problems done in this repository will be coming from books such as Cracking
The Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and Programming Interviews Exposed
by John Mongan, Eric Giguere, and Noah Kindler; however, there will also be problems from sites like GeeksForGeeks, HackerRank, etc.

I will be keeping this README as updated as possible on the resources being used throughout my enforcement process.
